# lab1_graphics

Polygon rendering in C++ using framebuffers.
Create an algorithm that can fill polygons of more than 4 points.

## Using Windows

This will create a build folder name and then you see an out.bpm which will have the result that was generated by the code.

```shell
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -S . -B build
```
You need to enter to the folder and use the command 'make' and this will create a executable.
```shell
cd build && make
```
we call the executable to create the image
```shell
call GAME.exe
```
Then we can see this image complete with this code
